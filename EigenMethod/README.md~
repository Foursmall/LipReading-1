Lip reading using Eigensequences

          Problems found in practical implementation of SVM lead us to go back to the basic eigensequence method. This is primarily used for  face identification. We developed an algorithm which superimpose the eigensequences of set of  images of test word and compute the similarity point with various trained sets. The one which give highest value has more similarity, hence it is identified as the spoken word.

          The overall problem is to be able to accurately recognize the lip movement  for a particular word and recognise the word uttered based on the outcome of the recognition process.
