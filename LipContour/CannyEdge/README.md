Canny Edge Detection method for lip contouring

*Canny Edge detection is applied.
*Morphological closing is applied to remove noise.
*Extracted contours from the output obtained after morphological
closing.

Problems
contouring was not accurate , can't fix the threshold value for canny edge detection - different imgs requires different values
